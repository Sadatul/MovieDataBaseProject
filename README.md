# Project Description
This our Level 1-Term 2 project. This was built using JavaFx and Socket Programming.

### Goal
The goal of this project was to introduce us with basics of OOP and socket programming. The project might seem simple and quite pointless, but it was a perfect one for university fresher, to ease him into software devolopment. Thought our experience with javafx was quite bad.

### Features:
  * Very basic movie database with filtering capabilites
  * A very basic server-client design with sockets
